    Biography
</h3>

<p>
  Hello, I'm Sanusi Islamiyat Oreoluwa, a passionate and driven individual with a rich background in Agriculture from the University of Ilorin, Ilorin, 
   Kwara state, Nigeria. My academic roots may be in agriculture, but my true calling lies in the tech world. I embarked on this journey in October 2022,
   drawn to crafting user-centered designs that drive business success.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I delved deeper into the world of tech, I discovered a new passion for Front-End Engineering in 2023. I realized that bringing designs to life and <br>
    creating functional, interactive products was an essential part of the tech ecosystem. This revelation sparked a desire to learn and grow in this field.<br>
    To fuel my growth, I sought out a supportive community, authentic learning platforms, and like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for tech. <br>
    That's when I found AltSchool Africa, where I'm currently a student with the ID <b>ALT/SOE/024/0462</b> . I'm excited to be part of a community that fosters
    growth, accountability, and motivation.  <br>Through my journey, I aim to leverage my skills in UI/UX design and Front-End Engineering to create innovative 
    solutions that make a meaningful impact.

    </h2>
<p> I chose AltSchool Africa, School of Engineering because I wanted an education that goes beyond theory and dives deep into practical, 
  real-world applications. The hands-on approach they offer really appealed to me—I want to be able to build and create, not just learn
   concepts in a vacuum.</p>

    I chose AltSchool Africa, School of Engineering because I wanted an education that goes beyond theory and dives deep into practical, 
  real-world applications. The hands-on approach they offer really appealed to me—I want to be able to build and create, not just learn
   concepts in a vacuum.

   </p>
  <p>
    The opportunity to learn from mentors who have been in the trenches of the tech industry was another big draw. Their experience is something 
    I know will be invaluable as I navigate my own path in this field.
  </p>

<p>
  Community is also a huge factor for me. AltSchool isn’t just about learning alone; it’s about being part of a network of like-minded people 
who are all pushing towards similar goals. That sense of belonging and support is something I’m really looking forward to.
</p>

<p>
  AltSchool’s commitment to innovation also stood out to me. I want to be on the cutting edge, learning skills that are not just relevant today,
  but will keep me ahead of the curve in the future.
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, I’m drawn to the school’s focus on lifelong learning. The tech world doesn’t stand still, and I want to be in an environment that
  encourages me to keep growing and evolving throughout my career. AltSchool Africa feels like the perfect place to make that a reality.
